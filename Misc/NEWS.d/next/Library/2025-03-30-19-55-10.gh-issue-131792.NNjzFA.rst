Improved performance of :func:`textwrap.dedent` by an average of ~2.4x,
(with improvements of up to 4x for large inputs),
and fixed a bug where blank lines with whitespace characters other than space
or horizontal tab were not normalised to the newline.
Patch by Adam Turner, Marius Juston, and Pieter Eendebak.
