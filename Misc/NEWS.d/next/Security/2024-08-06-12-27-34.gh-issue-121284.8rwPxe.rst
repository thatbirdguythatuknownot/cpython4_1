Fix bug in the folding of rfc2047 encoded-words when flattening an email message
using a modern email policy. Previously when an encoded-word was too long
for a line, it would be decoded, split across lines, and re-encoded. But commas
and other special characters in the original text could be left unencoded and
unquoted. This could theoretically be used to spoof header lines using
a carefully constructed encoded-word if the resulting rendered email was
transmitted or re-parsed.
